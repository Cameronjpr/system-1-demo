# System 1 Demo

This is a small React + Redux application, built largely to practice with Redux (and CSS). 

It's styled like the original Mac OS â€“ 1984's _System 1_. 

The toolbar is just for show at present, and I'm afraid any conversations taking place within _Messages_ will be rather one-sided.
